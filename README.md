# JEX-CTCPlugins
Plugins specifically managed for use in work associated with Joshua Lang's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin Madison.

# Issues
Please use the "Issues" tab to initiate bug reports, questions, enhancement requests, "Concept Proposals", etc. Label as you feel appropriate initially, but project "Collaborators" will be in charge of assigning/changing labels if necessary.

# Milestones
After establishment of the project, milestones will be used to aggregate issues associated with specific "Concept proposals".
